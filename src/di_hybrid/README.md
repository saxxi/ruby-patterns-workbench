# Dependency Injection hybrid approach

This code is heavily inspired by [this post](https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/dependency_injection_containers_vs_hardcoded_constants).

It allows the ability to inject code so we can mock arbitrary classes at any point without adding the overhead and complexity of specialised `DI` libraries.

Further more I have to say code doesn't look too much outside ruby convention.
